#Server's Resource Path
#A note, this path is relative to the location of
#SWAP.exe. For example, if you have a folder
#called "Resources" in the same folder as the
#SWAP executable the ResourcePath would
#be "\Resources\". Also, a '\' must be included
#at the beginning and end of a ResourcePath
#in order for it to properly work with the server
	ResourcePath = \Resources\

#Server's 404 page
	Page404 = 404_page.html

#Server's default index page (index.html)
	HomePage = home_page.html

#Server's protected path identifier
	LockedPageToken = LOCKED_FOLDER

#^this is used to hide certain folders/files from a remote user.
#Requested folders or files that have this token in their path name
#will return a access denied page

#Server's access denied page
	AccessDenied = no_access.html

#Location of PHP folder
	PhpLoc = C:\PHP\

#Uncomment if you are not using 
#the default PHP location (C:\PHP\)
#this should be an absolute path (ex: drive\folder\folder\PHP\).

#Thread max is essentially the maximum amount of connections the server can
